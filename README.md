# Graph Properties Analyzer
Final project for data structures

## What the program can do
- [x] has n vertices
- [x] has m edges
- [x] filing to store the graph
- [x] has a vertex of degree k
- [x] has m vertices of degree k
- [x] has a circuit ~~of length k~~
- [ ] has a simple circuit of length k
- [x] has m ~~simple~~ circuits ~~of length k~~
- [x] is connected
- [x] has an euler circuit
- [ ] `optional` has a Hamiltonian circuit
