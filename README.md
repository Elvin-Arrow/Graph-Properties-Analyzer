# Data-Structures-Final-Project
Final project for data structures
Following is the breakdown of all that which I am supposed to do in the project
## The graph
- [x] has n vertices
- [x] has m edges
- [x] filing to store the graph
- [x] has a vertex of degree k
- [x] has m vertices of degree k
- [x] has a circuit ~~of length k~~
- [ ] has a simple circuit of length k
- [ ] has m simple circuits of length k
- [x] is connected
- [x] has an euler circuit
- [ ] `optional` has a Hamiltonian circuit
